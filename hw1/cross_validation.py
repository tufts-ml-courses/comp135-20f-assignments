    Args
    ----
    estimator : any regressor object with sklearn-like API
        Supports 'fit' and 'predict' methods.
    x_NF : 2D numpy array, shape (n_examples, n_features) = (N, F)
        Input measurements ("features") for all examples of interest.
        Each row is a feature vector for one example.
    y_N : 1D numpy array, shape (n_examples,)
        Output measurements ("responses") for all examples of interest.
        Each row is a scalar response for one example.
    n_folds : int
        Number of folds to divide provided dataset into.
    random_state : int or numpy.RandomState instance
        Allows reproducible random splits.

    Returns
    -------
    train_error_per_fold : 1D numpy array, size n_folds
        One entry per fold
        Entry f gives the error computed for train set for fold f
    test_error_per_fold : 1D numpy array, size n_folds
        One entry per fold
        Entry f gives the error computed for test set for fold f

    # is perfectly explained by a linear regression model

    Args
    ----

        Total number of examples to allocate into train/test sets
    n_folds : int
        Number of folds requested
    random_state : int or numpy RandomState object

        One entry per fold
        Each entry is a 1-dim numpy array of unique integers between 0 to N

    Guarantees for Return Values
    ----------------------------
    Across all folds, guarantee that no two folds put same object in test set.
    For each fold f, we need to guarantee:
    * The *union* of train_ids_per_fold[f] and test_ids_per_fold[f]
    is equal to [0, 1, ... N-1]
    * The *intersection* of the two is the empty set
    * The total size of train and test ids for any fold is equal to N
